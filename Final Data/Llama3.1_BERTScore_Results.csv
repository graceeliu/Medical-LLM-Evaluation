ADAM_0003147_Sec2.txt,What causes Polycystic ovary syndrome ? (Also called: Polycystic ovaries; Polycystic ovary disease; Stein-Leventhal syndrome; Polyfollicular ovarian disease),"PCOS is linked to changes in hormone levels that make it harder for the ovaries to release fully-grown (mature) eggs. The reasons for these changes are unclear. The hormones affected are: - Estrogen and progesterone, the female hormones that help a woman's ovaries release eggs  - Androgen, a male hormone that is found in small amounts in women  Normally, one or more eggs are released during a woman's cycle. This is known as ovulation. In most cases, this release of eggs occurs about 2 weeks after the start of a menstrual period.  In PCOS, mature eggs are not released. Instead, they stay in the ovaries with a small amount of fluid around them. There can be many of these. However, not all women with the condition will have ovaries with this appearance.  These problems with the release of eggs can contribute to infertility. The other symptoms of this disorder are due to thehormoneimbalances. Most of the time, PCOS is diagnosed in women in their 20s or 30s. However, it may also affect teenage girls. The symptoms often begin when a girl's periods start. Women with this disorder often have a mother or sister who has similar symptoms.)","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common health problem caused by an imbalance of reproductive hormones.

The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available.

GHR_0000804_Sec1.txt,What is (are) polycystic kidney disease ? (Also called: PKD; polycystic renal disease),"Polycystic kidney disease is a disorder that affects the kidneys and other organs. Clusters of fluid-filled sacs, called cysts, develop in the kidneys and interfere with their ability to filter waste products from the blood. The growth of cysts causes the kidneys to become enlarged and can lead to kidney failure. Cysts may also develop in other organs, particularly the liver. Frequent complications of polycystic kidney disease include dangerously high blood pressure (hypertension), pain in the back or sides, blood in the urine (hematuria), recurrent urinary tract infections, kidney stones, and heart valve abnormalities. Additionally, people with polycystic kidney disease have an increased risk of an abnormal bulging (an aneurysm) in a large blood vessel called the aorta or in blood vessels at the base of the brain. Aneurysms can be life-threatening if they tear or rupture. The two major forms of polycystic kidney disease are distinguished by the usual age of onset and the pattern in which it is passed through families. The autosomal dominant form (sometimes called ADPKD) has signs and symptoms that typically begin in adulthood, although cysts in the kidney are often present from birth or childhood. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease can be further divided into type 1 and type 2, depending on the genetic cause. The autosomal recessive form of polycystic kidney disease (sometimes called ARPKD) is much rarer and is often lethal early in life. The signs and symptoms of this condition are usually apparent at birth or in early infancy.)",Polycystic kidney disease is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous cysts in the kidneys.

GHR_0000804_Sec3.txt,What are the genetic changes related to polycystic kidney disease ? (Also called: PKD; polycystic renal disease),"Mutations in the PKD1, PKD2, and PKHD1 genes cause polycystic kidney disease. Mutations in either the PKD1 or PKD2 gene can cause autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease; PKD1 gene mutations cause ADPKD type 1, and PKD2 gene mutations cause ADPKD type 2. These genes provide instructions for making proteins whose functions are not fully understood. Researchers believe that they are involved in transmitting chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus. The two proteins work together to promote normal kidney development, organization, and function. Mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 gene lead to the formation of thousands of cysts, which disrupt the normal functions of the kidneys and other organs. People with mutations in the PKD2 gene, particularly women, typically have a less severe form of the disease than people with PKD1 mutations. The signs and symptoms, including a decline in kidney function, tend to appear later in adulthood in people with a PKD2 mutation. Mutations in the PKHD1 gene cause autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. This gene provides instructions for making a protein whose exact function is unknown; however, the protein likely transmits chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell nucleus. Researchers have not determined how mutations in the PKHD1 gene lead to the formation of numerous cysts characteristic of polycystic kidney disease. Although polycystic kidney disease is usually a genetic disorder, a small percentage of cases are not caused by gene mutations. These cases are called acquired polycystic kidney disease. This form of the disorder occurs most often in people with other types of kidney disease who have been treated for several years with hemodialysis (a procedure that filters waste products from the blood).)","PKD is caused by a mutation in a gene called PKD1 or PKD2.

GHR_0000804_Sec4.txt,Is polycystic kidney disease inherited ? (Also called: PKD; polycystic renal disease),"Most cases of polycystic kidney disease have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. People with this condition are born with one mutated copy of the PKD1 or PKD2 gene in each cell. In about 90 percent of these cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. The other 10 percent of cases result from a new mutation in one of the genes and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Although one altered copy of a gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder, an additional mutation in the second copy of the PKD1 or PKD2 gene may make cysts grow faster and increase the severity of the disease. The rate at which cysts enlarge and cause a loss of kidney function varies widely, and may be influenced by mutations in other genes that have not been identified. Polycystic kidney disease also can be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. People with this form of the condition have two altered copies of the PKHD1 gene in each cell. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are not affected but are carriers of one copy of the altered gene.)","Polycystic kidney disease is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous cysts in the kidneys.

This artificial joint is called a prosthesis. What to Expect at Home : By the time you go home, you should be able to walk with a walker or crutches without needing much help. Most people do not need them after 2 to 4 weeks. Check with your health care provider about when to stop using crutches. You should also be able to dress yourself with only a little help and be able to get into and out of your bed or a chair by yourself. You should also be able to use the toilet without much help. You will need to be careful that you do not dislocate your artificial hip, especially in the first few months after surgery. You will need to learn exercises that make your new hip stronger and take special precautions. You will need to have someone with you at home 24 hours a day for 1 to 2 weeks after you leave the hospital or rehab center. You will need help preparing meals, bathing, moving around the house, and doing other daily activities. Over time, you should be able to return to your former level of activity. You will need to avoid some sports, such as downhill skiing or contact sports like football and soccer. But you should be able to do low impact activities, such as hiking, gardening, swimming, playing tennis, and golfing. Home Setup : Your bed should be low enough for your feet to touch the floor when you sit on the edge of the bed. Your bed should also be high enough so that your hips are higher than your knees when you sit on the edge. You will not need a hospital bed, but your mattress should be firm. Keep tripping hazards out of your home. - Learn to prevent falls. Remove loose wires or cords from areas you walk through to get from one room to another. Remove loose throw rugs. DO NOT keep small pets in your home. Fix any uneven flooring in doorways. Use good lighting. - Make your bathroom safe. Put hand rails in the bathtub or shower and next to the toilet. Place a slip-proof mat in the bathtub or shower. - DO NOT carry anything when you are walking around. You may need your hands to help you balance. Put things where they are easy to reach. Place a chair with a firm back in the kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, and other rooms you will use. This way, you can sit when you do your daily tasks. Set up your home so that you do not have to climb steps. Some tips are: - Set up a bed or use a bedroom on the first floor. - Have a bathroom or a portable commode on the same floor where you spend most of your day. Activity : You will need to be careful to not dislocate your new hip when you are walking, sitting, lying down, dressing, taking a bath or shower, and doing other activities. Keep moving and walking once you get home. DO NOT put your full weight on your side with the new hip until your doctor tells you it is okay. Start out with short periods of activity, and then gradually increase them. Your doctor or physical therapist will give you exercises to do at home. Use your crutches or walker for as long as you need them. Check with your provider before you stop using them. After a few days you may be able to do simple household chores. DO NOT try to do heavier chores, such as vacuuming or laundry. Remember, you will get tired quickly at first. Wear a small fanny pack or backpack, or attach a basket or strong bag to your walker, so that you can keep small household items, like a phone and notepad, with you. Wound Care : Keep your dressing (bandage) on your wound clean and dry. You may change the dressing according to when your provider told you to change it. Be sure to change it if it gets dirty or wet. Follow these steps when you change your dressing: - Wash your hands well with soap and water. - Remove the dressing carefully. DO NOT pull hard. If you need to, soak some of the dressing with sterile water or saline to help loosen it. - Soak some clean gauze with saline and wipe from one end of the incision to the other. DO NOT wipe back and forth over the same area. - Dry the incision the same way with clean, dry gauze. Wipe or pat in just 1 direction. - Check your wound for signs of infection. These include severe swelling and redness and drainage that has a bad odor. - Apply a new dressing the way you were shown. Sutures (stitches) or staples will be removed about 10 to 14 days after surgery. DO NOT shower until 3 to 4 days after your surgery, or when your provider told you to shower. When you can shower, let water run over your incision but DO NOT scrub it or let the water beat down on it. DO NOT soak in a bathtub, hot tub, or swimming pool. You may have bruising around your wound. This is normal, and it will go away on its own. The skin around your incision may be a little red. This is normal too. Self-care : Your provider will give you a prescription for pain medicines. Get it filled when you go home so you have it when you need it. Take your pain medicine when you start having pain. Waiting too long to take it will allow your pain to get more severe than it should. In the early part of your recovery, taking pain medicine about 30 minutes before you increase your activity can help control pain. You may be asked to wear special compression stockings on your legs for about 6 weeks. These will help prevent blood clots from forming. You may also need to take blood thinners for 2 to 4 weeks to lower your risk of blood clots. Take all your medicines the way your provider told you to. Your provider will tell you when it is okay to start sexual activity again. People who have a prosthesis, such as an artificial joint, need to carefully protect themselves against infection. You should carry a medical identification card in your wallet that says you have a prosthesis. You will need to take antibiotics before any dental work or invasive medical procedures. Check with your provider and make sure you tell your dentist that you had a hip replacement and need antibiotics before any dental work. When to Call Your Doctor : Call your health care provider if you have: - A sudden increase in pain - Chest pain or shortness of breath - Frequent urination or burning when you urinate - Redness or increasing pain around your incision - Drainage from your incision - Blood in your stools, or your stools turn dark - Swelling in one of your legs (it will be red and warmer than the other leg) - Pain in your calf - Fever greater than 101F (38.3C) - Pain that is not controlled by your pain medicines - Nosebleeds or blood in your urine or stools if you are taking blood thinners Also call if you: - Cannot move your hip as much as you could before - Fall or hurt your leg on the side that had surgery - Have increased pain in your hip Alternate Names : Hip arthroplasty - discharge; Total hip replacement - discharge; Hip hemiarthroplasty - discharge; Osteoarthritis - hip","Yes, I have information about Hip replacement - discharge (Also called: Hip arthroplasty - discharge; Total hip replacement - discharge; Hip hemiarthroplasty - discharge; Osteoarthritis - hip)",0.8016173839569092,0.7681388258934021,0.7845210433006287

It uses a smaller surgical cut. Also, fewer muscles around the hip are cut or detached. Description : To perform this surgery: - A cut will be made in one of three places -- on the back of the hip (over the buttock), on the front of the hip (near the groin), or on the side of the hip. - In most cases, the cut will be 3to 6 inches long. In a regular hip replacement surgery, the cut is 10to 12 inches long. - The surgeon will use special instruments to work through the small cut. - Surgery involves cutting and removing bone. The surgeon will remove some muscles and other tissues. Less tissue is removed than in regular surgery. Most of the time, muscles are not cut or detached. This procedure uses the same type of hip replacement implants as regular surgery. Why the Procedure is Performed : As in regular surgery, this procedure is done to replace or repair a diseased or damaged hip joint. This technique works better for people who are younger and thinner. Minimally invasive techniques may allow for a quicker recovery and less pain. You may not qualify for this procedure if - Your arthritis is quite severe. - You have medical problems that do not allow you to have this surgery. Talk with your surgeon about the benefits and risks. Ask if your surgeon has experience with this type of surgery. After the Procedure : People who have this surgery can have a shorter stay in the hospital and faster recovery. Ask if this procedure is a good choice for you.)","A minimally invasive hip replacement is an alternative to the traditional open surgery.

The most common cause of damage is osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis causes pain, swelling, and reduced motion in your joints. It can interfere with your daily activities. If other treatments such as physical therapy, pain medicines, and exercise haven't helped, hip replacement surgery might be an option for you.    During a hip replacement operation, the surgeon removes damaged cartilage and bone from your hip joint and replaces them with new, man-made parts.    A hip replacement can       - Relieve pain    - Help your hip joint work better    - Improve walking and other movements       The most common problem after surgery is hip dislocation. Because a man-made hip is smaller than the original joint, the ball can come out of its socket. The surgery can also cause blood clots and infections. With a hip replacement, you might need to avoid certain activities, such as jogging and high-impact sports.

ADAM_0000924_Sec1.txt,Do you have information about Communicating with patients?,"Patient education allows patients to play a bigger role in their own care. It also aligns with the growing movement toward patient- and family-centered care.  To be effective, patient education needs to be more than instructions and information. Teachers and health care providers need to be able to assess patient needs and communicate clearly.  The success of patient education depends largely on how well you assess your patient's:  - Needs  - Concerns  - Readiness to learn  - Preferences  - Support  - Barriers and limitations (such as physical and mental capacity, and low health literacy)    Often, the first step is to find out what the patient already knows. Use these guidelines to do a thorough assessment before starting patient education:  - Gather clues. Talk to the health care team members and observe the patient. Be careful not to make assumptions. Patient teaching based on incorrect assumptions may not be very effective and may take more time.  - Get to know your patient. Introduce yourself and explain your role in your patient's care. Review their medical record and ask basic get-to-know-you questions.  - Establish a rapport. Make eye contact when appropriate and help your patient feel comfortable with you. Pay attention to the person's concerns.  - Gain trust. Show respect and treat each person with compassion and without judgment.  - Determine your patient's readiness to learn. Ask your patients about their outlooks, attitudes, and motivations.  - Learn the patient's perspective. Talk to the patient about worries, fears, and possible misconceptions. The information you receive can help guide your patient teaching.  - Ask the right questions. Ask if the patient has concerns, not just questions. Use open-ended questions that require the patient to reveal more details. Listen carefully. The patient's answers will help you learn the person's core beliefs. This will help you understand the patient's motivation and let you plan the best ways to teach.  - Learn about the patient's skills. Find out what your patient already knows. You may want to use the teach-back method (also called the show-me method or closing the loop) to figure out what the patient may have learned from other health care providers. The teach-back method is a way to confirm that you have explained the information in a way that the patient they understands. Also, find out what skills the patient may still need to develop.  - Involve others. Ask if the patient wants other people involved with the care process. It is possible that the person who volunteers to be involved in your patient's care may not be the person your patient prefers to be involved. Learn about the support available to your patient.  - Identify barriers and limitations. You may perceive barriers to education, and the patient may confirm them. Some factors, such as low health literacy may be more subtle and harder to recognize.  - Take time to establish rapport. Do a comprehensive assessment.

These may include reading about the operation and talking to others with knee or hip problems. A key step is talking to your health care provider about your quality of life and goals for surgery. Surgery may or may not be the right choice for you. Only careful thought can help you make a decision. Who Benefits From Knee or hip Replacement Surgery? : The most common reason to have a knee or hip replaced is to provide relief from severe arthritis pain that limits your activities. Your provider may recommend replacement surgery when: - Pain prevents you from sleeping or doing normal activities. - You cannot move around by yourself and have to use a cane or walker. - Your pain has not improved with other treatment. - You understand the surgery and recovery involved. Some people are more willing to accept the limits knee or hip pain places on them. They will wait until the problems are more severe. Others will want to have joint replacement surgery in order to continue with sports and other activities they enjoy. Knee or hip replacements are most often done in people who are 60 and older. However, many people who have this surgery are younger. When a knee or hip replacement is done, the new joint may wear out over time. This is more likely to occur in people with more active lifestyles or in those who will likely live longer after surgery. Unfortunately, if a second joint replacement is needed in the future, it may not work as well as the first. Is There any Harm in Waiting? : For the most part, knee and hip replacement are elective procedures. This means these surgeries are done to provide relief for your pain, not for any other medical reason. In most cases, delaying surgery should not make joint replacement less effective if you choose to have it in the future. In some cases, the provider may strongly recommend surgery if deformity or extreme wear and tear on the joint affects other parts of your body. Also, if pain is preventing you from moving around well, the muscles around your joints may become weaker and your bones may become thinner. This may affect your recovery time if you have surgery at a later date. Why you may not be Able to Have Replacement Surgery : Your provider may recommend against knee or hip replacement surgery if you have any of the following: - Extreme obesity (weighing over 300 pounds) - Weak quadriceps, the muscles in the front of your thighs, that can make it very hard for you to walk and use your knee - Unhealthy skin around the joint - Previous infection of your knee or hip - Previous surgery or injuries that do not allow for a successful joint replacement - Heart or lung problems, which make major surgery more risky - Other health conditions that may not allow you to recover well from joint replacement surgery","Knee and hip replacement are common procedures for people with osteoarthritis.

It is usually plastic, but some surgeons are now trying other materials, like ceramic. The liner allows the hip to move smoothly. - A metal or ceramic ball that will replace the round head (top) of your thigh bone. - A metal stem that is attached to the thigh bone to make the joint more stable.

You usually get syphilis from sexual contact with someone who has it. It can also pass from mother to baby during pregnancy.    The early stage of syphilis usually causes a single, small, painless sore. Sometimes it causes swelling in nearby lymph nodes. If you do not treat it, syphilis usually causes a non-itchy skin rash, often on your hands and feet. Many people do not notice symptoms for years. Symptoms can go away and come back.    The sores caused by syphilis make it easier to get or give someone HIV during sex. If you are pregnant, syphilis can cause birth defects, or you could lose your baby.

To treat syphilis during pregnancy, penicillin is the drug of choice. Tetracycline cannot be used for treatment because it is dangerous to the unborn baby. Erythromycin may not prevent congenital syphilis in the baby. People who are allergic to penicillin should ideally be desensitized to it, and then treated with penicillin.

CSF is a clear fluid that flows in the space surrounding the spinal cord and brain.

How the Test is Performed : A sample of CSF is needed. A lumbar puncture, also called a spinal tap, is the most common way to collect this sample. For information on this procedure, see the article on lumbar puncture.  Other methods for collecting CSF are rarely used, but may be recommended in some cases. They include:  - Cisternal puncture  - Ventricular puncture  - Removal of CSF from a tube that is already in the CSF, such as a shunt or ventricular drain    The sample is sent to a laboratory for testing.

Why the Test is Performed : This test may be done to diagnose:  - Tumors  - Infections  - Inflammation of the central nervous system  - Delirium  - Other neurological and medical conditions

Normal Results : The glucose level in the CSF should be 50 to 80 mg/100 mL (or greater than 2/3 of the blood sugar level).  Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.  The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests.

ADAM_0001745_Sec1.txt,Do you have information about Glucagon blood test,"A glucagon blood test measures the amount of a hormone called glucagon in your blood. Glucagon is produced by cells in the pancreas. It helps control your blood sugar level by increasing blood sugar when it is too low.

How the Test is Performed : A blood sample is needed.

How to Prepare for the Test : Your health care provider will tell you if you need to fast (not eat anything) for a period of time before the test.

How the Test will Feel : When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.

Why the Test is Performed : Glucagon stimulates the liver to release glucose. As the level of blood sugar decreases, the pancreas releases more glucagon. And as blood sugar increases, the pancreas releases less glucagon.   The provider may measure glucagon level if a person has symptoms of:  - Diabetes  - Glucagonoma (rare tumor of the pancreas) with symptoms of a skin rash called necrotizing migratory erythema, weight loss, mild diabetes, anemia, stomatitis, glossitis  - Growth hormone deficiency in children  - Liver cirrhosis (scarring of the liver and poor liver function)  - Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)  - Multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (disease in which one or more of the endocrine glands are overactive or form a tumor)  - Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)

Normal Results : The normal range is 50 to 100 pg/mL.  Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Abnormal results may indicate that the person may have a condition described above under Why the Test Is Performed.   Glucagon can be increased by prolonged fasting.

Risks : Veins vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.  Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:  - Excessive bleeding  - Fainting or feeling light-headed  - Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)  - Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken))

The presence of glucose in the urine is called glycosuria or glucosuria.  Glucose level can also be measured using a blood test or a cerebrospinal fluid test.

How the Test is Performed : After you provide a urine sample, it is tested right away. The health care provider uses a dipstick made with a color-sensitive pad. The color the dipstick changes to tells the provider the level of glucose in your urine.   If needed,your provider may ask you to collect your urine at home over 24 hours. Your provider will tell you how to do this. Follow instructions exactly so that the results are accurate.

How to Prepare for the Test : Certain medicinescan change the result of this test. Before the test, tell your provider which medicines you are taking. Do not stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider.

How the Test will Feel : The test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort.

Why the Test is Performed : This test was commonly used to test for and monitor diabetes in the past. Now, blood tests to measure glucose level in the blood are easy to do and are used instead of the glucose urine test.  The glucose urine test may be ordered when the doctor suspects renal glycosuria. This is a rare condition in which glucose is released from the kidneys into the urine, even when the blood glucose level is normal.

Normal Results : Glucose is not usually found in urine. If it is, further testing is needed.  Normal glucose range in urine: 0to 0.8 mmol/l (0to 15 mg/dL)  The examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples.

What Abnormal Results Mean : Higher than normal levels of glucose may occur with:  - Diabetes: Small increases in urine glucose levels after a large meal are not always a cause for concern.    - Pregnancy: Up to half of women have glucose in their urine at sometime during pregnancy. Glucose in the urine may mean that a woman has gestational diabetes.  - Renal glycosuria: A rare condition in which glucose is released from the kidneys into the urine, even when blood glucose levelsare normal.

GHR_0000163_Sec1.txt,What is (are) celiac disease ? (Also called: celiac sprue; gluten enteropathy; sprue),"Celiac disease is a condition in which the immune system is abnormally sensitive to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder; autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. Without a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet, inflammation resulting from immune system overactivity may cause a wide variety of signs and symptoms involving many parts of the body.  Celiac disease can develop at any age after an individual starts eating foods containing gluten. The classic symptoms of the condition result from inflammation affecting the gastrointestinal tract. This inflammation damages the villi, which are small, finger-like projections that line the small intestine and provide a greatly increased surface area to absorb nutrients. In celiac disease, the villi become shortened and eventually flatten out. Intestinal damage causes diarrhea and poor absorption of nutrients, which may lead to weight loss. Abdominal pain, swelling (distention), and food intolerances are common in celiac disease. Inflammation associated with celiac disease may lead to an increased risk of developing certain gastrointestinal cancers such as cancers of the small intestine or esophagus.  Inflammation and poor nutrient absorption may lead to problems affecting many other organs and systems of the body in affected individuals. These health problems may include iron deficiency that results in a low number of red blood cells (anemia), vitamin deficiencies, low bone mineral density (osteoporosis), itchy skin rashes (dermatitis herpetiformis), defects in the enamel of the teeth, chronic fatigue, joint pain, poor growth, delayed puberty, infertility, or repeated miscarriages. Neurological problems have also been associated with celiac disease; these include migraine headaches, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and recurrent seizures (epilepsy). Many people with celiac disease have one or more of these varied health problems but do not have gastrointestinal symptoms. This form of the condition is called nonclassic celiac disease. Researchers now believe that nonclassic celiac disease is actually more common than the classic form.  Celiac disease often goes undiagnosed because many of its signs and symptoms are nonspecific, which means they may occur in many disorders. Most people who have one or more of these nonspecific health problems do not have celiac disease. On average, a diagnosis of celiac disease is not made until 6 to 10 years after symptoms begin.  Some people have silent celiac disease, in which they have no symptoms of the disorder. However, people with silent celiac disease do have immune proteins in their blood (antibodies) that are common in celiac disease. They also have inflammatory damage to their small intestine that can be detected with a biopsy.  In a small number of cases, celiac disease does not improve with a gluten-free diet and progresses to a condition called refractory sprue. Refractory sprue is characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, poor absorption of nutrients, and an increased risk of developing a type of cancer of the immune cells called T-cell lymphoma.) ","Celiac disease is a digestive disorder that causes damage to the small intestine. It is caused by an abnormal immune response to gluten, which is found in wheat, barley, and rye. Celiac disease is genetic, meaning that it runs in families. People who have celiac disease cannot tolerate gluten, and it can",0.9085485935211182,0.8060572743415833,0.8542397022247314

GHR_0000163_Sec3.txt,What are the genetic changes related to celiac disease ? (Also called: celiac sprue; gluten enteropathy; sprue),"The risk of developing celiac disease is increased by certain variants of the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that play a critical role in the immune system. The HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes belong to a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria.  The proteins produced from the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes attach (bind) to each other to form a functional protein complex called an antigen-binding DQ heterodimer. This complex, which is present on the surface of certain immune system cells, attaches to protein fragments (peptides) outside the cell. If the immune system recognizes the peptides as foreign (such as viral or bacterial peptides), it triggers a response to attack the invading viruses or bacteria.  Celiac disease is associated with an inappropriate immune response to a segment of the gluten protein called gliadin. This inappropriate activation of the immune system causes inflammation that damages the body's organs and tissues and leads to the signs and symptoms of celiac disease.  Almost all people with celiac disease have specific variants of the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes, which seem to increase the risk of an inappropriate immune response to gliadin. However, these variants are also found in 30 percent of the general population, and only 3 percent of individuals with the gene variants develop celiac disease.  It appears likely that other contributors, such as environmental factors and changes in other genes, also influence the development of this complex disorder.)","Celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the small intestine, caused by a reaction to gluten.

The weakness most often starts in the muscles around the eyes, causing drooping of the eyelids (ptosis) and difficulty coordinating eye movements, which results in blurred or double vision. In a form of the disorder called ocular myasthenia, the weakness remains confined to the eye muscles. In most people with myasthenia gravis, however, additional muscles in the face and neck are affected. Affected individuals may have unusual facial expressions, difficulty holding up the head, speech impairment (dysarthria), and chewing and swallowing problems (dysphagia) that may lead to choking, gagging, or drooling.  Other muscles in the body are also affected in some people with myasthenia gravis. The muscles of the arms and legs may be involved, causing affected individuals to have changes in their gait or trouble with lifting objects, rising from a seated position, or climbing stairs. The muscle weakness tends to fluctuate over time; it typically worsens with activity and improves with rest.  Weakness of the muscles in the chest wall and the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest cavity (the diaphragm) can cause breathing problems in some people with myasthenia gravis. About 10 percent of people with this disorder experience a potentially life-threatening complication in which these respiratory muscles weaken to the point that breathing is dangerously impaired, and the affected individual requires ventilation assistance. This respiratory failure, called a myasthenic crisis, may be triggered by stresses such as infections or reactions to medications.  People can develop myasthenia gravis at any age. For reasons that are unknown, it is most commonly diagnosed in women younger than age 40 and men older than age 60. It is uncommon in children, but some infants born to women with myasthenia gravis show signs and symptoms of the disorder for the first few days or weeks of life.

ADAM_0003672_Sec1.txt,Do you have information about Spinal and epidural anesthesia (Also called: Intraspinal anesthesia; Subarachnoid anesthesia; Epidural; Peridural anesthesia),"Summary : Spinal and epidural anesthesia are medicines that numb parts of your body to block pain. They are given through shots in or around the spine.Description : The doctor who gives you epidural or spinal anesthesia is called an anesthesiologist.  First, the area of your back where the needle is inserted is cleaned with a special solution. The area may also be numbed with a local anesthetic.  You'll likely receive fluids through an intravenous line (IV) in a vein. You may receive medicine through the IV to help you relax or sleep lightly.  For an epidural:  - The doctor injects medicine just outside of the sac of fluid around your spinal cord. This is called the epidural space.  - The medicine numbs, or blocks feeling in a certain part of your body so that you cannot feel pain. The medicine begins to take effect in about 10 to 20 minutes. It works well for longer procedures. Women often have an epidural during childbirth.  - A small tube (catheter) is often left in place. You can receive more medicine through the catheter to help control your pain during or after your procedure.   For a spinal:  - The doctor injects medicine into the fluid in your spinal cord. This is usually done only once, so you will not need to have a catheter placed.  - The medicine begins to take effect right away. It works well for shorter and simpler procedures.   Your pulse, blood pressure and oxygen level in your bloodare checked during the procedure. After the procedure, you will have a bandage where the needle was inserted. Why the Procedure is Performed : Spinal and epidural anesthesia have fewer side effects and risks than general anesthesia (asleep and pain-free). Patients usually recover their senses much faster. Sometimes, they have to wait for the anesthetic to wear off so they can walk.  Spinal anesthesia is often used for genital, urinary tract, or lower body procedures.  Epidural anesthesia is often used during labor and delivery, and surgery in the pelvis and legs.  Epidural and spinal anesthesia are often used when:  - The procedure or labor is too painful without any pain medicine.  - The procedure is in the belly, legs, or feet.  - Your body can remain in a comfortable position during your procedure.  - You want fewer systemic side effects and a shorter recovery than you would have from general anesthesia.Risks : Spinal and epidural anesthesia are generally safe. Ask your doctor about these possible complications:  - Allergic reaction to the anesthesia used  - Bleeding around the spinal column (hematoma)  - Difficulty urinating  - Drop in blood pressure  - Infection in your spine (meningitis or abscess)  - Nerve damage  - Seizures (this is rare)  - Severe headache Before the Procedure : Tell your doctor or nurse:  - If you are or could be pregnant  - What medicines you are taking, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription   During the days before the procedure:  - Tell your doctor about any allergies or health conditions you have, what medicines you are taking, and what anesthesia or sedation you have had before.  - If your procedure is planned, you may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other medicines that make it hard for your blood to clot.  - Ask your doctor which medicines you should still take on the day of your procedure.  - Arrange for a responsible adult to drive you to and from the hospital or clinic.  - If you smoke, try to stop. Ask your doctor or nurse for help quitting.   On the day of the procedure:  - You may be told not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before the surgery.  - Do not drink alcohol the night before and the day of your procedure.  - Take the medicines your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water.  - Your doctor or nurse will tell you what time to arrive at the hospital. Be sure to arrive on time. After the Procedure : After an epidural, the catheter in your back is removed. You lie in bed until you have feeling in your legs and can walk. You may feel sick to your stomach and be dizzy. You may be tired.  After spinal anesthesia, you lie flat in bed for a few hours to keep you from getting a headache. You may feel sick to your stomach and be dizzy. You may be tired.

You will probably stay awake but may not be able to speak.  Conscious sedation lets you recover quickly and return to your everyday activities soon after your procedure. Description : A nurse, doctor, or dentist, will give you conscious sedation in the hospital or outpatient clinic. Most of the time, it will not be an anesthesiologist. The medicine will wear off quickly, so it is used for short, uncomplicated procedures.  You may receive the medicine through an intravenous line (IV, in a vein) or a shot into a muscle. You will begin to feel drowsy and relaxed very quickly. If your doctor gives you the medicine to swallow, you will feel the effects after about 30 to 60 minutes.  Your breathing will slow down, and your blood pressure may drop a little. Your health care provider will monitor you every during your procedure to make sure you are okay. This person will stay with you at all times during the procedure.  You should not need help with your breathing. But you may receive extra oxygen through a mask or IV fluids through a catheter (tube) into a vein.  You may fall asleep, but you will wake up easily to respond to people in the room. You may be able to respond to verbal cues. After conscious sedation, you may feel drowsy and not remember much about your procedure. Why the Procedure is Performed : Conscious sedation is safe and effective for people who need minor surgery or a procedure to diagnose a condition.  Some of the tests and procedures conscious sedation may be used for are:  - Breast biopsy  - Dental prosthetic or reconstructive surgery  - Minor bone fracture repair  - Minor foot surgery  - Minor skin surgery  - Plastic or reconstructive surgery  - Procedures to diagnose and treat some stomach (upper endoscopy), colon (colonoscopy), lung (bronchoscopy), and bladder (cystoscopy) conditions Risks : Conscious sedation is usually safe. However, if you are given too much of the medicine, problems with your breathing may occur. A health care provider will be watching you during the whole procedure.  Providers always have special equipment to help you with your breathing, if needed. Only certain qualified health professionals can provide conscious sedation. Before the Procedure : Tell the health care provider:  - If you are or could be pregnant  - What medicines you are taking, even drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription    During the days before your procedure:  - Tell your provider about allergies or health conditions you have, what medicines you are taking, and what anesthesia or sedation you have had before.  - You may have blood or urine tests and a physical exam.  - Arrange for a responsible adult to drive you to and from the hospital or clinic for the procedure.  - If you smoke, try to stop. Smoking increases the risk for problems such as slow healing. Ask your provider for help quitting.    On the day of your procedure:  - Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.  - DO NOT drink alcohol the night before and the day of your procedure.  - Take the drugs your doctor told you to take with a small sip of water.  - Arrive at the hospital or clinic on time. After the Procedure : After conscious sedation, you will feel sleepy and may have a headache or feel sick to your stomach. During recovery, your finger will be clipped to a special device (pulse oximeter) to check the oxygen levels in your blood. Your blood pressure will be checked with an arm cuff about every 15 minutes.  You should be able to go home 1 to 2 hours after your procedure.  When you are home:  - Eat a healthy meal to restore your energy.  - You should be able to return to your everyday activities the next day.  - Avoid driving, operating machinery, drinking alcohol, and making legal decisions for at least 24 hours.  - Check with your doctor before taking any medicines or herbal supplements.  - If you had surgery, follow your doctor's instructions for recovery and wound care. Outlook (Prognosis) : Conscious sedation is generally safe, and is an option for procedures or diagnostic tests.)

ADAM_0001953_Sec1.txt,Do you have information about Hereditary urea cycle abnormality (Also called: Abnormality of the urea cycle - hereditary; Urea cycle - hereditary abnormality),"Summary : Hereditary urea cycle abnormality is an inherited condition that can cause problems with the removal of waste from the body in the urine. Causes : The urea cycle is a process in which waste (ammonia) is removed from the body. When you eat proteins, the body breaks them down into amino acids. Ammonia is produced from leftover amino acids, and it must be removed from the body.  The liver produces several chemicals (enzymes) that change ammonia into a form called urea, which the body can remove in the urine. If this process is disturbed, ammonia levels begin to rise.  Several inherited conditions can cause problems with this waste-removal process. People with a urea cycle disorder are missing a gene that makes the enzymes needed to break down ammonia in the body.  These diseases include:  - Argininosuccinic aciduria  - Arginase deficiency  - Carbamyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) deficiency  - Citrullinemia  - N-acetyl glutamate synthetase deficiency (NAGS)  - Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC)   As a group, these disorders occur in 1 in 30,000 newborns. Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is the most common of these disorders.  Boys are more often affected by ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency than girls. Girls are rarely affected. Those girls who are affected have milder symptoms and develop the disease later in life.  To get the other types of disorders, you need to receive a non-working copy of the gene from both parents. Sometimes parents don't know they carry the gene until their child gets the disorder. Symptoms : Typically, the baby begins nursing well and seems normal. However, over time the baby develops poor feeding, vomiting, and sleepiness, which may be so deep that the baby is difficult to awaken. This usually occurs within the first week after birth.  Symptoms include:  - Confusion  - Decreased food intake  - Dislike offoods that contain protein  - Increased sleepiness, difficulty waking up  - Nausea, vomiting Exams and Tests : The doctor will often diagnose these disorders when the child is still an infant.  Signs may include:  - Abnormal amino acids in blood and urine  - Abnormal level of orotic acid in blood or urine  - High blood ammonia level  - Normal level of acid in blood   Tests may include:  - Genetic tests  - Liver biopsy  - MRI or CT scan Treatment : Limiting protein in the diet can help treat these disorders by reducing the amount of nitrogen wastes the body produces. Special low-protein infant and toddler formulas are available.  It is important that a health care provider guide protein intake. The health care provider can balance the amount of protein so that the baby has enough to grow, but not enough to cause symptoms.  It is extremely important for people with these disorders to avoid fasting.  People with urea cycle abnormalities must also be very careful under times of stress, such as when they have infections. Stress, such as a fever, can cause the body to break down its own proteins. These extra proteins can make it difficult for the abnormal urea cycle to remove the byproducts.  Develop a plan with your doctor for when you are sick to avoid all protein, drink high carbohydrate drinks, and get enough fluids.  Most patients with urea cycle disorders will need to stay in the hospital at some point. During such times, they may be treated with medicines that help the body remove nitrogen-containing wastes. Dialysis may help rid the body of excess ammonia during extreme illness. Support Groups : National Urea Cycle Disorders Forum -- www.nucdf.org Outlook (Prognosis) : How well patients do depends on:  - Which urea cycle abnormality they have  - How severe it is  - How early it is discovered  - How closely they follow a protein-restricted diet   Babies diagnosed in the first week of life and put on a protein-restricted diet right away do well.  Sticking to the diet can lead to normal adult intelligence. Repeatedly not following the diet or having stress-induced symptoms can lead to brain swelling and brain damage.  Major stresses, such as surgery or accidents, can be complicated for these patients. Extreme care is needed to avoid problems during such periods. Possible Complications : - Coma  - Confusion and eventually disorientation  - Death  - Increases in blood ammonia level  - Swelling of the brain When to Contact a Medical Professional : If your child has a test that shows increased ammonia in the blood, have the child examined by a genetic or metabolic specialist. If there is a family history of urea cycle disorder, seek genetic counseling before trying to get pregnant.  A dietician is important to help plan and update a protein-restricted diet as the child grows. Prevention : As with most inherited diseases, there is no way to prevent these disorders. Prenatal testing is available. Genetic testing before an embryo is implanted may be available for those using in vitro fertilization.  Teamwork between parents, the affected child, and doctors can help prevent severe illness.)","Hereditary urea cycle abnormality is a condition that affects the body's ability to remove ammonia from the blood.

ADAM_0002180_Sec2.txt,What is (are) Infant test/procedure preparation ? (Also called: Test/procedure preparation - infant; Preparing infant for test/procedure),"Be aware that your child will likely cry, and restraints may be used. The most important way you can help your infant through this procedure is by being there and showing you care.  Crying is a normal response to the strange environment, unfamiliar people, restraints, and separation from you. Your infant will cry more for these reasons than because the test or procedure is uncomfortable.  WHY RESTRAINTS?  Infants lack the physical control, coordination, and ability to follow commands that older children usually have. Restraints may be used during a procedure or other situation to ensure your infant's safety. For example, in order to get clear test results on an x-ray, there cannot be any movement. Your infant may be restrained by hand or with physical devices.  If blood needs to be taken or an IV started, restraints are important in preventing injury to your infant. If your infant moves while the needle is being inserted, the needle could damage a blood vessel, bone, tissue, or nerves.  Your provider will use every means to ensure the safety and comfort of your baby. Beside restraints, other measures include medications, observation, and monitors.  DURING THE PROCEDURE  Your presence helps your infant during the procedure, especially if the procedure allows you to maintain physical contact. If the procedure is performed at the hospital or your health care provider's office, you will likely be able to be present.  If you are not asked to be by your infant's side and would like to be, ask your provider if this is possible. If you think you may become ill or anxious, consider keeping your distance, but staying in your infant's line of vision. If you are not able to be present, leaving a familiar object with your infant may be comforting.  OTHER CONSIDERATIONS  - Ask your provider to limit the number of strangers entering and leaving the room during the procedure, since this can raise anxiety.  - Ask that the provider who has spent the most time with your child perform the procedure.  - Ask that anesthetics be used if appropriate to reduce your child's discomfort.  - Ask that painful procedures not be done in the hospital crib, so that the infant does not come to associate pain with the crib. Many hospitals have special treatment rooms where procedures are done.  - Imitate the behavior you or your health care provider need the infant to do, such as opening the mouth.  - Many children's hospitals have child life specialists who are specially trained to educate patients and families and advocate for them during procedures.

GHR_0000063_Sec1.txt,What is (are) antiphospholipid syndrome ? (Also called: anti-phospholipid syndrome; antiphospholipid antibody syndrome; Hughes syndrome),"Antiphospholipid syndrome is a disorder characterized by an increased tendency to form abnormal blood clots (thromboses) that can block blood vessels. This clotting tendency is known as thrombophilia. In antiphospholipid syndrome, the thromboses can develop in nearly any blood vessel in the body, but most frequently occur in the vessels of the lower limbs. If a blood clot forms in the vessels in the brain, blood flow is impaired and can lead to stroke. Antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs.  Women with antiphospholipid syndrome are at increased risk of complications during pregnancy. These complications include pregnancy-induced high blood pressure (preeclampsia), an underdeveloped placenta (placental insufficiency), early delivery, or pregnancy loss (miscarriage). In addition, women with antiphospholipid syndrome are at greater risk of having a thrombosis during pregnancy than at other times during their lives. At birth, infants of mothers with antiphospholipid syndrome may be small and underweight.  A thrombosis or pregnancy complication is typically the first sign of antiphospholipid syndrome. This condition usually appears in early to mid-adulthood but can begin at any age.  Other signs and symptoms of antiphospholipid syndrome that affect blood cells and vessels include a reduced amount of blood clotting cells called platelets (thrombocytopenia), a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) due to their premature breakdown (hemolysis), and a purplish skin discoloration (livedo reticularis) caused by abnormalities in the tiny blood vessels of the skin. In addition, affected individuals may have open sores (ulcers) on the skin, migraine headaches, heart disease, or intellectual disability. Many people with antiphospholipid syndrome also have other autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus.  Rarely, people with antiphospholipid syndrome develop thromboses in multiple blood vessels throughout their body. These thromboses block blood flow in affected organs, which impairs their function and ultimately causes organ failure. These individuals are said to have catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS). CAPS typically affects the kidneys, lungs, brain, heart, and liver, and is fatal in over half of affected individuals. Less than 1 percent of individuals with antiphospholipid syndrome develop CAPS.)

However, seemingly unlikely or unusual sources are found every decade, with the common problem of improper handling during manufacture, at retail, or by consumers; some examples are chopped garlic in oil, canned cheese sauce, chile peppers, tomatoes, carrot juice, and baked potatoes wrapped in foil. In Alaska, foodborne botulism is caused by fermented fish and other aquatic game foods. Persons who do home canning should follow strict hygienic procedures to reduce contamination of foods, and carefully follow instructions on safe home canning including the use of pressure canners/cookers as recommended through county extension services or from the US Department of Agriculture. Oils infused with garlic or herbs should be refrigerated. Potatoes which have been baked while wrapped in aluminum foil should be kept hot until served or refrigerated. Because the botulinum toxin is destroyed by high temperatures, persons who eat home-canned foods should consider boiling the food for 10 minutes before eating it to ensure safety. Wound botulism can be prevented by promptly seeking medical care for infected wounds and by not using injectable street drugs. Most infant botulism cases cannot be prevented because the bacteria that causes this disease is in soil and dust.  The bacteria can be found inside homes on floors, carpet, and countertops even after cleaning.  Honey can contain the bacteria that causes infant botulism so, children less than 12 months old should not be fed honey. Honey is safe for persons 1 year of age and older.) ","Botulism is a severe and sometimes fatal illness that occurs when a person eats food contaminated with the botulinum toxin. The botulinum toxin is a nerve poison produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The toxin is found in certain foods, such as canned foods, honey, and fish",0.8520594239234924,0.7973569631576538,0.8238010406494141

ADAM_0003951_Sec1.txt, Do you have information about Toddler development,"Summary : Toddlers are children ages 1 - 3.  CHILD DEVELOPMENT THEORIES  Cognitive (thought) development skills typical for toddlers include:  - Early use of instruments or tools  - Following visual (then later, invisible) displacement (moving from one place to another) of objects  - Understanding that objects and people are there, even if you can't see them (object and people permanence)    Personal-social development in the toddler stage focuses on the child learning to adjust to society's demands, while trying to maintain independence and a sense of self.   These milestones are typical of children in the toddler stages. Some variation is normal. Talk to your health care provider if you have questions about your child's development.   PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT  The following are signs of expected physical development in a toddler:  GROSS MOTOR SKILLS (use of large muscles in the legs and arms)  - Stands alone well by 12 months  - Walks well by 12 - 15 months (Ifa child is not walking by 18 months, he or she should be evaluated by a health care provider.)  - Learns to walk backwards and up steps with help at about 16 - 18 months  - Jumps in place by about 24 months  - Rides a tricycle and stands briefly on one foot by about 36 months    FINE MOTOR SKILLS (use of small muscles in hands and fingers)  - Makes tower of three cubes by around 15 months  - Scribbles by 15 - 18 months  - Can use spoon by 24 months  - Can copy a circle by 36 months    LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT  - Uses 2 - 3 words (other than Mama or Dada) at 12 - 15 months  - Understands and follows simple commands (such as ""bring to Mommy"") at 14 - 16 months  - Names pictures of items and animals at 18 - 24 months  - Points to named body parts at 18 - 24 months  - Begins to say his or her own name at 22 - 24 months  - Combines 2 words at 16 to 24 months (There is a range of ages at which children are first able to combine words into sentences. Talk to your child's health care provider if the toddler cannot make sentences by 24 months.)  - Knows gender and age by 36 months    SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT  - Indicates some needs by pointing at 12 - 15 months  - Looks for help when in trouble by 18 months  - Helps to undress and put things away by 18 - 24 months  - Listens to stories when shown pictures and can tell aboutrecent experiences by 24 months  - Cantake partin pretend play and simple games by 24 - 36 months    BEHAVIOR  Toddlers are always trying to be more independent. This creates safety concerns as well as discipline challenges. The child must be consistently taught the limits of appropriate vs. inappropriate behavior.  When toddlers try out activities they haven't yet mastered, they can get frustrated and angry. Breath-holding, crying, screaming, and temper tantrums may often occur.  It is important for a child at this stage to:  - Learn from experiences  - Rely on boundaries between acceptable and unacceptable behaviors    SAFETY  Toddler safety is very important.  - Parents need to be aware that the child can now walk, run, climb, jump, and explore. This new stage of movement makes child-proofing the home very important. Window guards, gates on stairways, cabinet locks, toilet seat locks, electric outlet covers, and other safety features are needed to keep the child safe.  - Put the toddler in a safety restraint (toddler car seat) when riding in a car.  - Do not leave a toddler unattended for even short periods of time. Remember, more accidents occur during the toddler years than at any other stage of childhood.  - Make clear rules about not playing in streets or crossing without an adult.  - Falls are a major cause of injury. Keep gates or doors to stairways closed, and use guards for all windows above the ground floor. Do not leave chairs or ladders in areas that are likely to tempt the toddler into climbing up to explore new heights. Use corner guards on furniture in areas where the toddler is likely to walk, play, or run.  - Poisoning is a common cause of toddler illness and death. Keep all medicines in a locked cabinet. Keep all toxic household products (polishes, acids, cleaning solutions, chlorine bleach, lighter fluid, insecticides, or poisons) in a locked cabinet or closet. Many household and garden plants, such as toad stools, may cause serious illness or death if eaten. Ask your child's health care provider for a list of common poisonous plants.  - If someone in the household owns a firearm, make sure it is unloaded and locked in a secure place.  - Keep toddlers away from the kitchen with a safety gate, or place them in a playpen or high chair. This will eliminate the danger of burns from pulling hot foods off the stove or bumping into the hot oven door.  - Do not let toddlers play in water alone. A toddler may drown, even in shallow water in a bathtub. Parent-child swimming lessons can be another safe and enjoyable way for toddlers to play in water. Never leave a child unattended near a pool, open toilet, or bathtub. Toddlers cannot learn how to swim and cannot be independent near any body of water.    PARENTING TIPS  - The toddler years are for children to learn accepted rules of behavior. It is important for parents to be consistent both in modeling behavior (behaving the way you want your child to behave), and in pointing out inappropriate behavior in the child. Recognize and reward positive behavior. You can introduce time-outs for negative behavior, or for going beyond the limits you set for your child.  - The toddler's favorite word may seem to be ""NO!!!"" It is important for parents not to fall into a pattern of negative behaviorusing yelling, spanking, and threats.  - Teach children the proper names of body parts.  - Stress the unique, individual qualities of the child.  - Teach the concepts of please, thank you, and sharing with others.  - Read to the child regularly. This will help develop verbal skills.  - Toddlers thrive on regularity. Major changes in their routine are hard for them. Toddlers should have regular nap, bed, snack, and meal times.  - Toddlers should not be allowed to eat many snacks throughout the day. Too many snacks can take away the desire to eat regular meals, which tend to offer more balanced nutrition.   - Traveling with a toddler or having guests at the house can disrupt the childs routine. This may make the child more irritable. In these situations, reassure the child and try to get back to a routine in a calm way.)",Toddler development includes:,0.849692165851593,0.7290439605712891,0.7847580909729004

It is perfectly normal for an infant to cry when hungry, thirsty, tired, lonely, or in pain. It is also normal for a baby to have a fussy period in the evening.  But, if an infant cries too often, it may be a sign of something that needs treatment.

Causes : Infants may cry because of any of the following:  - Boredom or loneliness  - Colic  - Discomfort or irritation from a wet or dirty diaper, excessive gas, or feeling cold  - Hunger or thirst  - Illness  - Infection (a likely cause if the crying is accompanied by irritability, lethargy, poor appetite, or fever. You should call your baby's health care provider)  - Medicines  - Normal muscle jerks and twitches that disturb the sleep  - Pain  - Teething

Home Care : Home care depends on the causes. Follow your provider's advice.   If the infant seems constantly hungry despite short, frequent feedings, talk to your provider about normal growth and feeding times.  If crying is due to boredom or loneliness, it may be helpful to touch, hold, and talk to the infant more and place the infant within sight. Place baby-safe toys where the child can see them. If crying is due to sleep disturbance, wrap the baby firmly in a blanket before putting the infant to bed.  For excessive crying in infants due to cold, dress the infant warmly or adjust the temperature of the room. If adults are cold, the baby is likely cold also.  Always check for possible causes of pain or discomfort in a crying baby. When cloth diapers are used, look for diaper pins that have become loose or loose threads that have become tightly wrapped around fingers or toes. Diaper rashes also can be uncomfortable.  Take your baby's temperature to check for fever. Check your baby head-to-toe for any injuries. Pay particular attention to the fingers, toes, and genitalia. It is not uncommon for a hair to get wrapped around part of your baby, such as a toe, creating pain.

When to Contact a Medical Professional : Call the provider if:  - A baby's excessive crying remains unexplained and does not go away in 1 day, despite attempts at home treatment  - The baby has other symptoms, such as fever, along with the excessive crying

What to Expect at Your Office Visit : The provider will examine your baby and ask about the child's medical history and symptoms. Questions may include:  - Is the child teething?  - Is the child bored, lonely, hungry, thirsty?  - Does the child seem to have a lot of gas?  - What other symptoms does the child have?
